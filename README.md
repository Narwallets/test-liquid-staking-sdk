# Meta Pool liquid-stake-sdk

MetaPool.app is a liquid staking protocol built on NEAR. People stake their NEAR tokens with MetaPool and receive a liquid "stNEAR" token representing their staked NEAR. stNEAR is a yield accruing token, and its price versus NEAR increases every epoch (15hs). Users can use their stNEAR in the world of DeFi to get extra yield, and can unstake and recover their original NEAR any time (the protocol is permissionless and non-custodial)

## Installation

$ npm install @metapool/liquid-staking-sdk
